# Running-Button-JS
This is test project to understand the mechanics of JavaScript.

This project is inspired from YouTube. i was searching for new code ideas and design and found this fun project where the button is basically running all over the page. at that time i was just at level 0.5 out of 10 about JavaScript. in short i was total noob at JavaScript.
So i tried the codes to understand JS better. it was a fun project.
